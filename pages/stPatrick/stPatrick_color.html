            <h2>Coloring all the objects</h2>
            <p>With all 3 objects in place, it is time to color them, switch to viewport shading to see your objects turning from grey to white, this indicates the viewport shading this active</p>

            <h3>Step 1: color the clover</h3>
            <p>let's color the clover first, this is the easiest to color as a clover's color is... green</p>
            <p>click on material in the sidebar and create a new material (click on the new material button)</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color20.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>switch base color to green (or perhaps you have a different idea on what this clover should look like?)</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color30.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>color the remaining leaves green, since you have made the material, you just need to look for it, and reuse it.</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color40.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">

            <h3>Step 2: color the hat</h3>
            <p>The hat is going to introduce how to color specific areas black (the hat), and specific areas yellow (the belt)</p>
            <p>To do this, go to edit mode first then color the whole thing black by creating a new material and set base color to black. </p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color50.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>use the 'alt + left click' to select faces at a direction, create the new material with a base color of yellow and click assign to color a specific area to color them, here is a video of me attempting to do this: </p>
            <video class="img-fluid" controls>
                <source src="../../videos/2025-03-08 08-44-03.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>A bit of a struggle, but essentially the steps are: select hat > create yellow material > select areas > assign material to them</p>

            <h3>Step 3: color the pot</h3>
            <p>The pot of gold has only 2 colors, black and yellow, since you already made them, just do what step 1 and 2 did. Ideally you would want to go back to object mode to color the whole thing black, then go to edit mode to paint certain areas yellow</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color70.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">

            <figure class="text-center">
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>"I have to click EVERY FACE in THAT pot o' gold?!?!"</p>
                </blockquote>
                <figcaption class="blockquote-footer">
                    ME
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The idea is to paint the buldge with yellow, any black spots in the gold area will make the object less belivable, there are ways to make it easier, the x-ray mode, assuming you are extruding up and no downs, you can simply highlight the whole thing and color them, the 'alt-left click'</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color80.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">

            <h3>Step 4: Camera</h3>
            <p>First let's get the camera in place, find the camera logo (or press numpad 0,if you have a numpad)</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color85.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>Next, there are a number of things to consider, pressing the 'N' key will open up the viewing properties, click lock camera to view, this is so you can freely move your camera as if you are viewing an object.</p>
            <p>Then you need to click on the camera object in the scene collection to open access to the camera properties, there you can set the lens type, there are 3 types in that camera, perspective, orthographic (isometric) and panoramic. We will use orthographic and adjust orthographic scale to fit all objects in the screen.</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color90.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">

            <h3>Step 5: add a flat surface and render</h3>
            <p>'Shift + A' to add a mesh -> plane, this is just a flat surface, scale as big as possible so the camera just sees the color white and no grays seen</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color95.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>Click the rendering shading to start seeing your object getting rendered</p>
            <p>note that you can change the type of rendering, EEVEE is fast, but that uses fake lighting to simulate how an object would look like, msot video games use this</p>
            <p>But cycles renders objects accurately, there is a huge difference</p>
            <img src="../../img/stPatrick/color100.png" class="img-fluid" alt="stPatrick">
            <p>Finally you can click render image in the render tab</p>
